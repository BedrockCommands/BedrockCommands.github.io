## üìå Project Info  

This project is powered by the **[Bedrock Commands Community](https://discord.com/servers/bedrock-commands-community-924894457894174740)** as part of its annual **[Map Making Program](/Cook-Off/about/)**, running from **February to November**.

The **2025 winning map concept**, "**Cook-Off!**", was selected through a community vote from three finalist concepts. These finalists were carefully chosen by the staff team from six original submissions by some of the community's top creators.  

This year's **Project Director** is **[@CaliFerr](https://github.com/CaliFerr)**, the author of the **Cook-Off!** concept.
